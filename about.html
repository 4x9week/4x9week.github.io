            Welcome to 4√ó9-week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Minimal wallpapers. 4 styles. 9 colors. Every week.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found myself looking for simple wallpapers with graphics of things I liked and couldn‚Äôt find many. So I decided to make some.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bear with me, but I‚Äôll start with a lot of manga and anime ones. As I get the hang of this we‚Äôll see if I can expand to other subjects. Ideas are welcome. Get in touch via the social links below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äú4√ó9-week‚Äù will read ‚Äúfour nine week‚Äù. Or does ‚Äúfour by nine per week‚Äù sound better? Would definitely make more sense when you look at the logo. ‚ÄúFour nine week‚Äù could be our ‚Äúif you know, you know‚Äù thing. üòâ

      <h3>questions</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>How do I download the wallpapers?</h4>
        <div class="p">
          <p>
            Click on the thumbnail of the wallpaper style you want. This will open a notion page where you can download all 9 colors for the chosen style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hover over the image and click the arrow icon to download. Or click the "..." icon, then click download.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How do you make the wallpapers?</h4>
        <div class="p">
          <p>
            We take a screenshot of the panel from an manga page or panel image already existing on the web, then
            manipulate the color to match one of our 9 colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take extreme care to only use images directly from the author so that the correct credits can be applied
            and we are not sharing other people‚Äôs art. Those credits can be found at the top of the download page for each
            wallpaper style, as well as in the descriptions of any 4x9week social media post about the wallpapers
            (currently only Instagram and Pinterest are active).
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Is this legal?</h4>
        <div class="p">
          <p>
            Technically yes. We do not aim to harm the integrity of the work or the creators by sharing the wallpapers.
            Our goal is to celebrate the media that we enjoy by providing a little piece of it that you can use as a
            wallpaper. Completely free for you. You can think of this being similar to sharing a gif or meme of the
            anime you like.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are wondering about copyright laws, here is a piece of info we found:
          </p>
          <p>
            From the Copyright Laws and Regulations Japan 2023:
            <i>"5.4 Examples of specific exceptions are as follows: (i) a work can be reproduced for personal use; (ii) a
              work can be exploited by way of quotation in accordance with fair practices and to the justifiable extent
              for the purpose of the quotation; and (iii) a work can be printed in an authorised textbook for public
              education."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Meaning:
              <i>"The revision will still allow for the downloading of a &#34;few frames&#34; from a manga of several dozen
                pages or more, or posting photographs where the manga is not the focus of the photo (for example, appearing
                in reflections). The revision will also not punish people who download derivative works (such as d≈çjin or
                fan fiction) or parodies."</i>
